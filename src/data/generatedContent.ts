His general research goals are directed towards the characterization of molecular transactions ruling healthy vs pathological gene expression programs. In  2023, he received a HFRI grant for a collaborative projects on transcriptional modelling, as well as a SYNERGY-FORTH grant for studying specificity of biological condensates. He is an expert in transcription regulation, (epi-)genomics and transcriptomics and relies on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and mathematical modeling approaches to study the role and function of nascent RNA in genome organization and regulation. He graduated with a MSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Paris VI university in France in 2002 and obtained his PhD in Molecular Medicine in 2006 from the University of Portsmouth, UK. He became particularly interested in understanding fundamental molecular/cellular mechanisms such as how specific genes encoded in our DNA are accurately expressed at the appropriate time and location for normal cell/tissue functions. As post-Doctoral fellow in Dr Thanos lab at the BRFAA in Greece  from 2006 to 2012, he was the first scientist in Greece to perform/analyze NGS experiments. He then worked from 2013 to 2021 as a senior Post-doc in the lab of Dr Fousteri at the BSRC Fleming in Greece to develop bioinformatics skills to discover how cells switch to a transcriptional 'safe' mode after DNA damage. In particular, he used the integration of multi-omics data to identify how transcription-coupled repair guarantees uniform maintenance of a low risk of mutagenesis in actively transcribed genes to limit cancer development and premature aging. Through his past and recent activities, he developed a significant collaboration network to offer his expertise in NGS-based analyses, he has published valuable scientific work in prestigious international journals, and he has appeared as an invited speaker at top international conferences and workshops.",

He established his independent research group at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus (USA) in 2013 and has been a group leader at IMBB-FORTH since 2019.\n \nOur interdisciplinary team brings together biologists, physicists, and computer scientists to dissect how molecular, cellular and mechanical cues interact to orchestrate the emergence of biological form through patterned cell activities. The group has established two genetically and optically tractable arthropod models—the shrimp-like crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and the beetle Tribolium castaneum—as powerful systems for studying tissue and organ morphogenesis during development and evolution.\n \nAt the core of our research is the development of advanced genetic and genomic tools in these species, enabling functional tests of hypotheses about morphogenetic processes that cannot be adequately addressed in traditional model organisms. These molecular genetic approaches are integrated with state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy and image analysis pipelines to quantify morphogenesis in live embryos from a bottom-up cellular perspective, both under normal and experimentally perturbed conditions. Comparative analyses across Parhyale, Tribolium and classic model organisms have begun to reveal conserved principles or even deep homologies in the molecular and cellular mechanisms shaping animal tissues, as well as how these mechanisms evolve to generate the remarkable diversity of forms in nature.\n \nOur research has been supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation, European Molecular Biology Organization, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, and other organizations. Pavlopoulos has supervised more than forty undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers. He has been teaching since 2006 in courses on Molecular Cellular Biology, Embryology, Animal Development and Evolution, Light-Sheet Microscopy and Tissue Morphogenesis organized by the University of Crete Graduate Programs, EMBO, the Marine Biological Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, UC Santa Barbara and other institutions.",

His general research goals are directed towards the characterization of molecular transactions ruling healthy vs pathological gene expression programs. In  2023, he received a HFRI grant for a collaborative projects on transcriptional modelling, as well as a SYNERGY-FORTH grant for studying specificity of biological condensates. He is an expert in transcription regulation, (epi-)genomics and transcriptomics and relies on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and mathematical modeling approaches to study the role and function of nascent RNA in genome organization and regulation. He graduated with a MSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Paris VI university in France in 2002 and obtained his PhD in Molecular Medicine in 2006 from the University of Portsmouth, UK. He became particularly interested in understanding fundamental molecular/cellular mechanisms such as how specific genes encoded in our DNA are accurately expressed at the appropriate time and location for normal cell/tissue functions. As post-Doctoral fellow in Dr Thanos lab at the BRFAA in Greece  from 2006 to 2012, he was the first scientist in Greece to perform/analyze NGS experiments. He then worked from 2013 to 2021 as a senior Post-doc in the lab of Dr Fousteri at the BSRC Fleming in Greece to develop bioinformatics skills to discover how cells switch to a transcriptional 'safe' mode after DNA damage. In particular, he used the integration of multi-omics data to identify how transcription-coupled repair guarantees uniform maintenance of a low risk of mutagenesis in actively transcribed genes to limit cancer development and premature aging. Through his past and recent activities, he developed a significant collaboration network to offer his expertise in NGS-based analyses, he has published valuable scientific work in prestigious international journals, and he has appeared as an invited speaker at top international conferences and workshops.",

He established his independent research group at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus (USA) in 2013 and has been a group leader at IMBB-FORTH since 2019.\n \nOur interdisciplinary team brings together biologists, physicists, and computer scientists to dissect how molecular, cellular and mechanical cues interact to orchestrate the emergence of biological form through patterned cell activities. The group has established two genetically and optically tractable arthropod models—the shrimp-like crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and the beetle Tribolium castaneum—as powerful systems for studying tissue and organ morphogenesis during development and evolution.\n \nAt the core of our research is the development of advanced genetic and genomic tools in these species, enabling functional tests of hypotheses about morphogenetic processes that cannot be adequately addressed in traditional model organisms. These molecular genetic approaches are integrated with state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy and image analysis pipelines to quantify morphogenesis in live embryos from a bottom-up cellular perspective, both under normal and experimentally perturbed conditions. Comparative analyses across Parhyale, Tribolium and classic model organisms have begun to reveal conserved principles or even deep homologies in the molecular and cellular mechanisms shaping animal tissues, as well as how these mechanisms evolve to generate the remarkable diversity of forms in nature.\n \nOur research has been supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation, European Molecular Biology Organization, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, and other organizations. Pavlopoulos has supervised more than forty undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers. He has been teaching since 2006 in courses on Molecular Cellular Biology, Embryology, Animal Development and Evolution, Light-Sheet Microscopy and Tissue Morphogenesis organized by the University of Crete Graduate Programs, EMBO, the Marine Biological Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, UC Santa Barbara and other institutions.",
